8_worms.mat

Write the name of the initial condition file on the top line

21_worms_tangled_IC.mat is a good initial condition for worm_simulator_fast.m, the other initial conditions work better with worm_simulator.m

An initial condition file must contain the following:

1) W0, a 3N x n array. N is the number of filaments, n is the number of discrete points along each filament. Each 3 x n array in W0 is a separate filament, e.g. rows 1-3 are filament 1, rows 4-6 are filament 2, etc. Every point of W0 needs to be in the upper half space, e.g. have z > 2h, where h is the filament radius. For good results, the spacing of points along each filament should be the constant and equal to 2h for each filament.

2) diskR, the radius of the cylindrical container in which the simulation takes place. All points of W0 should lie inside diskR.
